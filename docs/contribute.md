feature requests, and general questions or discussions. When creating or
interacting with issues, please keep the following in mind:

### 1. Search for existing issues

Before creating a new issue, search the
[existing issues](https://github.com/apui-avignon-university/warren-tdbp/issues)

### 2. Creating a new issue

When opening an issue, provide as much information as possible when writing

issue is relevant, a contributor will apply the changes to the project. The
issue will then be automatically closed when the PR is merged.

Issues will be closed by project maintainers if they are deemed invalid. You can
always reopen an issue if you believe it hasn't been adequately addressed.

## Releases

The Warren TdbP project has multiple services maintained in a single Git repository
(_aka_ a monorepo): each service has its own life cycle with its own releases.

We use Git tags to trigger CI builds of the Warren TdbP's artifacts (PyPI/NPM
packages and Docker images). To make a new release, depending on the service you
are releasing, you need to apply the following Git tag pattern conventions:

| Type         | Service  | Git tag pattern              | Example       |
| ------------ | -------- | ---------------------------- | ------------- | 
| Back-end     | API      | `v[0-9]+.[0-9]+.[0-9]+-api`  | `v2.0.1-api`  |
|              | APP      | `v[0-9]+.[0-9]+.[0-9]+-app`  | `v1.3.6-app`  |
| Front-end    | tdbp     | `v[0-9]+.[0-9]+.[0-9]+-ui`   | `v5.1.0-ui`   |
| Distribution | \*       | `v[0-9]+.[0-9]+.[0-9]+`      | `v2.0.0`      |
| Helm         | \*       | `v[0-9]+.[0-9]+.[0-9]+-helm` | `v1.2.1-helm` |

!!! Note "About Warren TdbP distributions"

    A Warren **distribution** is considered as a "meta" package corresponding
    to a consistent combination of services releases that are known to work well
    together. This pattern will be used to tag Docker images and the documentation.
