# Deploy Warren-TdBP with Docker Swarm

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding with the deployment of Warren-TdBP, ensure that you have Docker Engine
installed and configured with Swarm mode: [Docker
Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

## Tutorial

This tutorial provides a step-to-step guide to deploying Warren-TdBP on a local Docker
Engine cluster in swarm mode. By following this tutorial, you will:

- set up a small cluster consisting of one manager node on your local machine,
- deploy Warren TdBP using the production Compose file.

> ⚠️ Caution! In this tutorial:
> - We are setting up a cluster with only one manager node and no workers. For a more
>   reliable setup in a real-world scenario, it's recommended to create a cluster with
>   one manager node and multiple worker nodes (refer to the Docker
>   [documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/how-swarm-mode-works/nodes/)).

> - We are deploying a Postgresql database to the cluster on a single node, which will
>   be used by both the api and the app, without any replicas. It's generally
>   recommended to avoid running databases (or any stateful service) directly on the
>   cluster to prevent potential data loss. On a side note, if deploying the database on
>   the cluster is necessary, it should be done with replication in mind for better
>   safety.

### Initializing the cluster

Initialize a local cluster using the following command:
```bash
docker swarm init
```

To view the current state of the swarm, use:
```bash
docker info
```

For informations about nodes in the swarm, execute:
```bash
docker node ls
```

> 💡 Tip 
> If you want to add more nodes to the cluster, refer to this
> [documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/swarm-tutorial/add-nodes/).

### Creating Volumes

Warren-TdBP requires a PostgreSQL database for persistency, along with volumes for
static and media files used by the `app` service.

Create the necessary volumes using the following commands:
```bash
docker volume create postgres_data
docker volume create media
docker volume create static
```

> For additional volume creation options (e.g. size, file system, device), refer to the
> [documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/volume_create/).

### Creating Logging

Adjust services' logging configuration by creating a new`config` object from the
project's sources:

```bash
docker config create logging_config src/api/logging-config.prod.yaml
```

This command creates a new config named `logging_config` from the content of
`src/api/logging-config.prod.yaml`. This config is mounted under the `/app/core/`
directory of the `api` service during the deployment.

### Creating the Network

To enable service-to-service communication, create an overlay network and attach
services to it. In the `docker-compose.prod.yml` file, all services are connected to
the `backend` network, which needs to be created:
```bash
docker network create -d overlay --attachable backend
```

Ensure Warren-TdBP API is connected to a Ralph instance for fetching statements. If
using Docker Swarm to deploy Ralph, make sure both services are running on the same
`backend` network.

### Deploying Warren-TdBP

Docker Engine in swarm mode can deploy services defined in a Compose file. Deploy the
following services defined in `docker-compose.prod.yml`: `postgresql`, `api` and `app`. 

Adjust the `docker-compose.prod.yml` file and the environment files (`postgresql.env`,
`api.env` and `app.env`) as per your requirements, including Warren's docker image tags

Once ready, deploy the service using the command: 
```bash
docker stack deploy tdbp --compose-file production/docker-compose.prod.yml --with-registry-auth
```

Check if the services are up and running with:
```bash
docker service ls
```

View all the running containers with:
```bash
docker ps
```

For investigating further in case a service is not healthy, use:
```bash
docker inspect --format "{{json .State.Health }}" CONTAINER_ID | jq
```
_Note_: this command requires that [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) is installed
on your operating system.

### Migrating the databases

Two databases (`POSTGRES_API_DB` and `POSTGRES_APP_DB`, defined in the `postgresql.env`)
are required on the `postgresql` instance. In this tutorial, they are both created (if
they don't exist) during container initialization with the `init.sh` file. 

To migrate these databases, you can use the commands:
- for the API:
```
docker exec -it <API_CONTAINER_ID> warren migration upgrade head
```
- for the APP:
```
docker exec -it <APP_CONTAINER_ID> python manage.py migrate
```

### Exposing Warren-TdBP with Caddy

To make Warren-TdBP accessible to an external Learning Management System (LMS), we will
utilize [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/docs/install) as a reverse proxy. While Caddy
can be launched via its CLI, we strongly recommend employing a service manager for
automatic restarts (refer to the [documentation](https://caddyserver.com/docs/running)).

Begin by creating a Caddyfile which contains your configuration:
```
app.example.com {
reverse_proxy :8000
}

api.example.com {
reverse_proxy:8100
}
```

Launch Caddy from the directory containing the Caddyfile with the command:
```bash
caddy start
```

Caddy is now operational, directing traffic to your pods.

### Configuring Warren-TdBP for LTI integration

With Warren-TdBP running, let's configure it as an external LTI tool within our chosen
LMS. Start by creating an admin account on the Warren-TdBP app using:
```bash
docker exec -it $(docker ps -q -f name=tdbp_app) python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Access the `app` admin page at `http://localhost:8000/admin`.

Next, add an LTI consumers for Moodle, by providing the Moodle site URL. Add an LTI
passport for this newly created Moodle consumer. An Oauth consumer key and a shared
secret will be generated on save.

Now that we have our LTI passport, log into the Moodle admin site and add an external
tool by following this
[documentation](https://docs.moodle.org/403/en/LTI_External_tools).

LTI tool URL: `https://app.example.com`
LTI version: `LTI 1.1`
Supports Deep linking: Enabled
Content Selection URL: `https://app.example.com/lti/select`
Share launcher's name with tool: Always
Share launcher's email with tool: Always

You can now create a new activity from the Warren-TdBP tool inside a course!
